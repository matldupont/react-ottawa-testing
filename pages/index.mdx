# I have testing on the üß†

---

## Releasing a feature is kinda like taking a road trip.
(stay with me...)

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h1>First!</h1></Step>
  <Step><p>Gotta pack a bag</p></Step>
  <Step><p>3 bags, actually.</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Some similar items, some different</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

## The bags are your components, functions and hooks

**Unit tests** will ensure they're packed properly.

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>Each bag needs a list</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>Writing as I pack could work, but it may slow me down</p></Step>
  <Step><p>I can write my daughter's list, but she can pack</p></Step>
  <Step><p>I'm only packing next week, but I can make my list now</p></Step>
  <Step><p>I can effortlessly add/remove items from the list until I pack</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>The list is your spec file</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>Pure TDD can be more effective, but not absolutely necessary</p></Step>
  <Step><p>A PM, QA or a team Lead can write the spec.</p></Step>
  <Step><p>We can write it early and make it easy on the dev process</p></Step>
  <Step><p>It's faster and cheaper to write a component or function with a defined spec</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

# SHIFT LEFT!

# How do we write unit tests!?

## Second!

![Packed](/packed.jpg)

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h1>Load the car</h1></Step>
  <Step><p>I don't care what's in the bags</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Do they all fit?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Should some be accessible?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Am I strapping a paddleboard to the roof?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Shit, I need another list</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>A list of bags, not their contents</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>My wife can write the list, I can load the car</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Focused solely on loading the car</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Positioning the bags in relation to each other</p></Step>
  <Step><p>I don't need to be driving to know if it'll work</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

## How the bags fit in car - Integration Tests

**Integration tests** will ensure the bags all fit as an integrated system of units in my car.

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>Again, the list is your spec file</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>Does the feature work with all the parts integrated?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Does selecting a service show the booking header?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Does my service list change if I choose a professional?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>I don't actually need to get the list from the server</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Again, I can write this spec early.</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

## The cost of waiting

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>Without a packing list</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>Packing the bags while they're in the car?!</p></Step>
  <Step><p>One massive list with everything for every bag, all at once?!</p></Step>
  <Step><p>I'd spend more time walking than packing!</p></Step>
  <Step><p>A tedious, error-prone nightmare.</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

Integration tests shouldn't test the details of the units, only that they work together.
 
Otherwise, we have a ton of complicated tests that take longer to write and run.
 
Re-testing details that should already be nailed down.

---

# SHIFT LEFT, DAMMIT!

---

# How do we write integration tests!?

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h1>Third!</h1></Step>
  <Step><p>Getting where I'm going</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Do I have my route planned out?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Do I have enough gas for the trip?</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Are my pit stops planned?</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>An itinerary (... another list)</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>A short one</p></Step>
  <Step><p>What's in the bags? IDGAF</p></Step>
  <Step><p>If I can see out the back window, I trust the rest is good.</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Rubber hits the road and we're off</p></Step>
</Steps>

---

## The trip itself - End-to-End Testing

**End-to-End tests** validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the software as a whole, including all the integrated components and external dependencies*.

---

*There are a few flavours of E2E Testing.

Post-deployment production E2E Tests and CI/CD E2E Tests. 

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h2>The itinerary is your spec</h2></Step>
  <Step><p>Comparatively short list of items to check</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Run in a headless browser/simulator environment</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Validates user flows a layer above integration tests</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Real world scenario testing</p></Step>
</Steps>

## Shit...

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h1>We forgot the cooler! Turn back!</h1></Step>
  <Step><p>Where is it? The basement ...I think</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Gross! It has old hotdogs in it ü§¢</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Car's full! Rearrange and now I can barely see.</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Brewery has no ice and we forgot to get some on the way. </p></Step>
</Steps>

# SHIFT F^@$%ING LEFT!

---

<Steps>
  <Step><h1>Compounding Effects</h1></Step>
  <Step><p>The later we test things, the slower it is</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Late changes have wider effects on quality</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Much more costly</p></Step>
  <Step><p>Way more stress and risk of mistakes</p></Step>
</Steps>
